<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_INFLUENCE_OF_HABIT_IN">THE INFLUENCE OF HABIT IN
PLANT-LIFE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old maxim regarding the power of habit
is usually and rightly regarded as exhibiting a
thorough application to the regulation of animal
life. Not merely in human affairs is habit
allowed to be ‘a second nature;’ but in lower
life as well, the influence of use and wont is
plainly perceptible. A dog or cat equally with
a human being is under the sway of the
accustomed. That which may be at first unusual,
soon becomes the normal way of life. Even, as
the physiologist can prove, in a very large part
of ordinary human existence, we are the creatures
of habit quite as much as we are the children
of impulse. It is easily provable, for example,
that such common acts as are involved in reading,
writing, and speaking, are merely perpetuated
habits. At first, these acquirements present difficulties
to the youthful mind. A slow educative
process is demanded, and then, by repetition
and training, the lower centres of the brain
acquire the power of doing the work of higher
parts and centres. We fall into the habit, in
other words, of writing and speaking, just as
our muscles fall into the way of guiding our
movements. No doubt, a large part of the
difficulty is smoothed away for us by the fact
that we inherit the aptitude for the performance
of these common actions. But they fall, nevertheless,
into the category of repeated and inherited
habits; and equally with the newer or fresh ideas
and tasks we set ourselves, the actions of common
life may be regarded as merely illustrating the
curious and useful effect of repeated and fixed
habit on our organisation.</p>

<p>Recent researches in the field of plant-life,
however, it is interesting to note, show that habit
does not reign paramount in the animal world
alone. The plant-world, it has been well
remarked, too often presents to the ordinary
observer the aspect of a sphere of dull pulseless
life, wherein activity is unrepresented, and
wherein the familiar actions of animal existence
are unknown. Nothing is farther from the
truth than such an idea. The merest tyro in
botany is nowadays led to study actions in plants
which are often indistinguishable from those of
animal life. Instead of the plant-world being
a huge living domain which never evinces a
sign of sensation or activity, the botanist can
point to numerous cases in which not only are
the signs of sensibility as fully developed in the
plant as in the animal, but in which also many
other phases of animal life are exactly imitated.
We thus know of plants which droop their
leaves on the slightest touch, and exhibit as
delicate a sensitiveness as many high animals,
and a much finer degree of sensibility than
most low animals. Then, again, when, with
the microscope, we inspect that inner plant-life
which is altogether hidden from the outer world,
we see that the tissues of plants exist in a state
of high activity. Currents of protoplasm are
seen to run hither and thither through the
plant-cells, and active movements to pervade
the whole organisation of the living organism.
Vital activity is the rule, and inertness the
exception, in plant-life; and the discovery of
this fact simply serves to impress anew upon us
the danger and error of that form of argument
which would assume the non-existence of higher
traits of life in plants, simply because they are
invisible to the unassisted sight.</p>

<p>The effects of habit on plant-life are nowhere
better seen than in the curious differences which
exist between the food and feeding of certain
plants and the practices of their more familiar
plant-neighbours. The food of an ordinary green
plant, as is well known, consists of inorganic
matters. Water, minerals in solution, ammonia,
and carbonic acid gas, constitute the materials
from which an ordinary plant derives its sustenance.
It is curious to reflect that all the beauty
of flower and foliage merely represents so much
carbonic acid gas, water, and minerals, fashioned
by the wondrous vital powers of the plant into
living tissues. Yet such is undoubtedly the case.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">{114}</span>
Between the food of animals and green plants, we
perceive this great difference—namely, that whilst
the animal demands water, oxygen gas, and minerals—all
three being inorganic materials—it also
requires ready-made living matter to supply the
wants of its frame. This ready-made living
matter the animal can only obtain from other
animals or from plants; and as a matter of fact,
animals demand and require such materials to
feed upon. In one sense, the plant, then, exhibits
higher powers than the animal, for it is more
constructive. It can build up its frame from
non-living matter entirely; whilst the animal,
less constructive, requires a proportion of already
living matter in its food. What has just been
said of the food of plants applies to those which
possess green colouring-matter associated with
the plant-tissues. This green colour, so universally
diffused throughout the plant kingdom, is
called <i>chlorophyll</i> by the botanist. It exists in
the cells of plants in the form of granules, and
is intimately associated with the living matter
or ‘protoplasm’ of the cells. The presence or
absence of green colour in a plant makes all the
difference in the world to its habits. The want
of this chlorophyll, in fact, converts the habits
of the plant into that of the animal.</p>

<p>If we select a plant which possesses no green
colour, we may be prepared for some startling
revelations respecting the mode of life of such
a plant. Examples of a total want of chlorophyll
are seen in the <i>fungi</i>, that large group of plants
which harbours our mushrooms, toad-stools, and
like organisms as its familiar representatives. If
we inquire how the non-green fungus lives, we
shall discover, firstly, that it is like an animal
in respect, firstly, of the gas on which it feeds.
The green plant, we saw to feed on carbonic acid
gas; but the fungus, like the animal, inhales
oxygen. Furthermore, a still more remarkable
fact must be detailed respecting the difference
between the habit of the green plants and their
non-green neighbours. When an ordinary green
plant takes in the carbonic acid gas which it
has obtained from the atmosphere—whither it has
come from the lungs of animals and elsewhere—it
performs a remarkable chemical operation.
The green colour enables it, in the presence of
light, to decompose the carbonic acid gas (which
consists of carbon and oxygen) into its elements.
The carbon is retained by the plant, and goes to
form the starch and other compounds manufactured
by the organism. But the oxygen, which
is not required, at least in any quantity, in the
living operations of the green plant, is allowed
to escape back to the atmosphere, where it becomes
useful for animal respiration. Thus, what
the animal exhales (carbonic acid), the green
plant inhales; and what the green plant exhales
(oxygen), the animal inhales. We have here a
remarkable cycle of natural operations, which
suggests how beautifully the equilibrium of
nature is maintained. It may be added that
the want of light converts even the green plant
to somewhat animal habits. In the dark, the decomposition
of carbonic acid is suspended, chlorophyll
alone being insufficient for the analysis.
Then, the green plant seems to inhale oxygen
and to emit carbonic acid, like the animal and
its non-green relative; to return, however, to its
normal habit with the returning light. At
the same time, the plain difference of habit in
respect of the want of green colour in the fungi
and other plants, is in itself a remarkable fact
of plant-life.</p>

<p>Other differences in habit may also be noted
between the plants which possess green colour
and those that want it. We have already alluded
to the fact that green plants feed on inorganic
or lifeless matters, and that they build up these
matters into their living tissues. On the other
hand, the habits of the fungi and non-green
plants lead them to resemble animals in that
they feed upon organic materials; that is, on
matter which is derived from other plants or
animals. As a matter of fact, most fungi are
found growing in places where decaying organic
matters exist. The gardener, in growing edible
fungi, supplies them with such materials in the
form of manure. Again, those fungi which cause
skin-diseases in man (for example, ringworm)
feed on the tissues in which they are parasitic,
and in so doing absorb organic matter. The
plants which are not green, in this way appear
to prefer organic matters, like animals. In habits,
therefore, they present a striking contrast to their
green neighbours.</p>

<p>The habit of <i>parasitism</i>, however, which has
just been alluded to is a powerful means of
inaugurating and maintaining change of life and
living in plants. A parasitic being is one which
lives in or upon some other living organism.
There are degrees of parasitism, however: some
parasites are mere ‘lodgers,’ so to speak; others
both board and lodge at the expense of their
host, and these latter are of course the more
typical parasites of the two. But there are
even degrees and differences to be seen in the
behaviour of plant-lodgers and boarders. For
example, mistletoe is a plant of peculiar habits,
in respect that whilst its roots enter the substance
of the tree-host to which it is attached,
and drink up so much of the sap that host is
elaborating for its own use, it also can make
food-products for itself. For the green leaves
of mistletoe, like the leaves of other plants,
take in carbonic acid gas, and decompose it,
as already described, retaining the carbon, and
setting the oxygen free. On the other hand,
a parasitic fungus will not elaborate any food-products
for itself; and hence it is, if anything,
a more complete and typical ‘boarder’ even than
mistletoe. The effects of habit in plant-life are
here seen in a double sense and aspect. Not
only is it through the exercise of ‘habit’ that
a plant becomes a parasite; but it is a variation
in the parasitic and acquired habit for a parasitic
plant to develop its own special ways of
feeding. Habit within habit is thus seen to
operate powerfully in bringing about the existent
phases of the life of plants.</p>

<p>Plants without green colour are, however, not
the only members of the vegetable world in
which the habit of feeding like animals has
been inaugurated. Some of the most remarkable
chapters in botany have been recently written
on the habits of so-called carnivorous or insectivorous
plants—that is, plants which subsist on
insects in other forms of animal life, and which
lay traps designed to capture their unwary prey.
The Common Sundew (<i>Drosera</i>) of our bogs and
marshes catches flies and other insects by means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">{115}</span>
of an ingenious arrangement of sensitive tentacles
which beset its leaf, aided by the gummy
secretion of the leaf itself. The Venus’ Flytrap
(<i>Dionæa</i>) captures insects by converting its leaf
into a closing trap; the alarm to close being
conveyed to the sensitive parts of the plant by
the insect touching one or more of the six
sensitive hairs which are seen on the surface of
the leaf. The Side-saddle plants (<i>Sarracenia</i>) of
the New World and the Pitcher plants (<i>Nepenthes</i>)
of the Old World likewise capture insects.
Their leaves form receptacles, in which, as is
well known, flies and other insects are literally
drowned. Within the Sarracenia’s hollow leaf,
a honey-secretion is found, together with a limpid
fluid found at the bottom of the pitcher. There
seems little doubt that flies and other insects,
attracted by the honey-secretion, pass into the
pitcher, and are then suffocated by the fluid found
below. This much has been proved—namely,
that the fluid has an intoxicating effect on
insects, and that, once entrapped, the insects
ultimately perish in the pitchers. It is equally
notable that their retreat is cut off by the presence
of pointed hairs, which, on the <i>facilis
descensus</i> principle, and by pointing downwards,
allow the insect easy admittance, but present an
array of bayonet-points on its attempt to escape.
In the Nepenthes or Pitcher plants of the Old
World, insects are similarly captured, and are
prevented from escaping by various contrivances,
such as a series of incurved hairs or hooks, or
allied apparatus.</p>

<p>At first sight, there seems a plain reason for
classifying together all these insect-capturing
plants, especially when it is discovered that they
utilise the insects they capture for food. Botanists
did not realise till recently that the capture of
insects by plants was a strictly utilitarian and
purposive act—namely, that its intent was to
feed and nourish the plant. Once awaking to
this truth, much that was formerly mysterious
in the life and ways of these plants became clear.
They captured the insects and fed upon them;
in these words were found the clue to and explanation
of a seeming anomaly in plant-life. These
plants might thus be supposed simply to differ
from other green plants, and to resemble the
fungi in their preference for an animal dietary,
in part at least. For, with their roots in the
soil, and possessing green leaves, they appear to
subsist partly upon the matters on which ordinary
green plants live, and partly upon organic matters,
like mistletoe. But a further study of these curious
plants shows that the whole facts of the case
are hardly to be comprised within this somewhat
narrow compass. Habit within habit again
appears as the principle which has wrought out
important differences between the various kinds
of insect-eating plants. Taking the case of the
Sundew first, we discover that this plant actually
digests its insect-food. From glands with which
the leaf is provided, fluids are poured out which
resemble the gastric juice of our own stomachs
in their digestive properties. The matter of the
insect-body is thus absorbed into the substance
and tissues of the plant, just as the substance of
our own food passes, through digestion, to become
part and parcel of our own tissues. Of the Venus’
Flytrap, the same remarks hold good. This plant
will digest fragments of raw beef as readily as
its own insect-prey. The closed leaf is converted
into a kind of temporary stomach, within which
the imprisoned insect is killed, digested, and its
tissues absorbed, to nourish the plant. In the
Pitcher plants, a similar result happens to the
insect-prey. Digestion and absorption of the
nutrient parts of the prey are the duties performed
by the modified leaves.</p>

<p>The foregoing facts would therefore seem to
present a remarkable uniformity in the life of
the plants just mentioned. Similarity of habits
would seem to reign supreme, under variations
in the method of capturing the insect-prey.
Turning now to the case of the Side-saddle
plants and their allies, we discover how remarkably
the habits of these plants have come to
differ. Investigation has shown that the flies,
which are apparently drowned in the pitchers
of Sarracenia in a manner exactly similar to that
in which they fall victims to the artifice of the
Pitcher plants, in reality are subjected to a widely
different action. The Pitcher plant digests its
flies, as we have seen; but in the Side-saddle
plants no digestion takes place. What happens
in the latter appears to consist of a simple process
of decay. The insects are allowed to putrefy
and decompose amid the watery fluid which
drowns them; and in due time, the pitcher
becomes filled with a fluid which has been compared
to ‘liquid manure.’ It is this decomposing
solution, then, which is duly absorbed by the
Sarracenia. Rejecting this idea, there can be
no other explanation given of the use of the
elaborate fly-catching ‘pitchers.’ And, moreover,
analogy would force us to conclude that the
explanation just given is correct. If fungi feed
on decomposing organic matters, why should not
a Sarracenia exhibit like habits? No reasonable
reply can be given save that which sees in the
Sarracenia a curious difference of habit from the
apparently similar Pitcher plants. The latter,
in other words, eat their meal fresh; the Sarracenias,
like humanity with its game, eat their
meat in a ‘high’ state.</p>

<p>The ordinary feeding of plants may, lastly, be
cited, by way of showing how marvellously intricate
must be the conditions which operate to
produce differences in habits, sometimes amounting
almost to special likings on the part of vegetable
units for one kind of food, and equally
special dislikes to other foods. The farmer knowing
the preference for certain food-elements by
certain plants, requires to ‘rotate’ his crops, to
avoid injurious exhaustion of his soils. For
instance, buckwheat will not flourish unless potassium
is supplied to it. The chloride of potassium,
and next to it the nitrate, are the minerals preferred
by this plant. Still more extraordinary is
the preference exhibited by one of the violet tribe
(<i>Viola calaminaria</i>), which will only grow in soils
that contain zinc. Here, the effects of habit are
seen in a singularly clear fashion; for there seems
every reason to assume that the partiality for a
by no means common element in soils, has been
an acquired, and not an original taste of the
plants which exhibit it. The botanist thus
becomes aware of the existence of a ‘taste,’ or
‘selective power’ as it is termed, in the plant-world,
influencing their food, and, as a matter
of logic, affecting also their structure, functions,
and entire existence. It has been found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">{116}</span>
the pea and bean tribe (<i>Leguminosæ</i>) specially
desire lime, amongst their requirements. Potatoes
exhibit a special partiality for potash; and turnips
share this taste. Plants in which the seed
assumes a high importance, as in most of our
cereals, on the other hand, demand phosphoric
acid; and certain plants, such as wheat, will
withdraw large quantities of silica or flint from
the soil. Iodine is found characteristically in
seaweeds, and the element in question is obtained
from the <i>kelp</i> produced by burning marine
plants.</p>

<p>No better commentary on the life and habits
of plants in respect of their food-tastes can be
given than in the words of an eminent physiologist,
who, speaking of the food of the corn-plant,
says: ‘Without siliceous (or flinty) earth,
that plant cannot acquire sufficient strength to
sustain itself erect, but forms a creeping stem,
feeble and pale; without calcareous earth (or
lime), it dies even before the appearance of the
second leaf; without soda and without potash,
it never attains a greater height than between
four and five inches; without phosphorus, though
growing straight and regularly formed, it remains
feeble and does not bear fruit; when iron is
present in the soil, it gives that deep green tint
so familiar to us and grows rapidly robust;
without manganese, it develops in a stunted
manner and produces few flowers.’ After the
revelations of chemistry concerning the habits
and tastes of plants and the bearing of proper
food on their growth, it is not to be wondered
at that scientific agriculture should be regarded
as the only solution of many of the present-day
difficulties of the farmer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a second, nobody answered a word; this
quiet declaration of an honest self-sacrifice took
them all, even Nora, so utterly by surprise.
Then Edward murmured musingly: ‘And it
was for this that you gave up the prospect of
living at Cambridge, and composing symphonies
in Trinity gardens!’</p>

<p>The mulatto smiled a deprecating smile. ‘Oh,’
he cried timidly, ‘you mustn’t say that. I didn’t
want to make out I was going to do anything
so very grand or so very heroic. Of course, a
man <i>must</i> satisfy himself he’s doing something
to justify his existence in the world; and much
as I love music, I hardly feel as though playing
the violin were in itself a sufficient end for a
man to live for. Though I must confess I should
very much like to stop in England and be a
composer. I’ve composed one or two little
pieces already for the violin, that have been
played with some success at public concerts.
Sarasate played a small thing of mine last winter
at a festival in Vienna. But then, besides, my
father and friends live in Trinidad, and I feel
that that’s the place where my work in life is
really cut out for me.’</p>

<p>‘And your second great passion?’ Marian inquired.
‘You said you had a second great passion.
What is it, I wonder?—Oh, of course, I see—your
profession.’</p>

<p>(‘How could she be so stupid!’ Nora thought
to herself. ‘What a silly girl! I’m afraid of
my life now, the wretched man’ll try to say
something pretty.’)</p>

<p>‘O no; not my profession,’ Dr Whitaker
answered, smiling. ‘It’s a noble profession, of
course—the noblest and grandest, almost, of all
the professions—assuaging and alleviating human
suffering; but one looks upon it, for all that,
rather as a duty than as a passion. Besides,
there’s one thing greater even than the alleviation
of human suffering, greater than art with
all its allurements, greater than anything else
that a man can interest himself in—though I
know most people don’t think so—and that’s
science—the knowledge of our relations with the
universe, and still more of the universe’s relations
with its various parts.—No, Mrs Hawthorn; my
second absorbing passion, next to music, and
higher than music, is one that I’m sure ladies
won’t sympathise with—it’s only botany.’</p>

<p>‘Goodness gracious!’ Nora cried, surprised into
speech. ‘I thought botany was nothing but the
most dreadfully hard words, all about nothing
on earth that anybody cared for!’</p>

<p>The mulatto looked at her open-eyed with a
sort of mild astonishment. ‘What?’ he said.
‘All the glorious lilies and cactuses and palms
and orchids of our beautiful Trinidad nothing
but hard words that nobody cares for! All the
slender lianas that trail and droop from the
huge buttresses of the wild cotton-trees; all the
gorgeous trumpet-creepers that drape the gnarled
branches of the mountain star-apples with their
scarlet blossoms; all the huge cecropias, that
rise aloft with their silvery stems and fan-shaped
leaves, towering into the air like gigantic candelabra;
all the graceful tree-ferns and feathery
bamboos and glossy-leaved magnolias and majestic
bananas and luxuriant ginger-worts and
clustering arums: all the breadth and depth of
tropical foliage, with the rugged and knotted
creepers, festooned in veritable cables of vivid
green, from branch to branch among the dim
mysterious forest shades—stretched in tight
cordage like the rigging yonder from mast to
mast, for miles together—oh, Miss Dupuy, is
that nothing? Do you call that nothing, for a
man to fix his loving regard upon? Our own
Trinidad is wonderfully rich still in such natural
glories; and it’s the hope of doing a little in my
spare hours to explore and disentomb them, like
hidden treasures, that partly urges me to go back
again where manifest destiny calls me to the land
I was born in.’</p>

<p>The mulatto is always fluent, even when uneducated;
but Dr Whitaker, learned in all the
learning of the schools, and pouring forth his
full heart enthusiastically on the subjects nearest
and dearest to him, spoke with such a ready,
easy eloquence, common enough, indeed, among
south Europeans, and among Celtic Scots and
Irish as well, but rare and almost unknown
in our colder and more phlegmatic Anglo-Saxon
constitutions—that Nora listened to him, quite
taken aback by the flood of his native rhetoric,
and whispered to herself in her own soul:
‘Really, he talks very well after all—for a coloured
person!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, of course, all those things are very lovely,
Dr Whitaker,’ Marian put in, more for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">{117}</span>
sake of drawing him out—for he was so interesting—than
because she really wanted to disagree
with him upon the subject. ‘But then, that
isn’t botany. I always thought botany was a
mere matter of stamens and petals, and all sorts
of other dreadful technicalities.’</p>

<p>‘Stamens and petals!’ the mulatto echoed
half contemptuously—‘stamens and petals! You
might as well say art was all a matter of
pigments and perspective, or music all a matter
of crotchets and quavers, as botany all a matter
of stamens and petals. Those are only the
beggarly elements: the beautiful pictures, the
glorious oratorios, the lovely flowers, are the
real things to which in the end they all minister.
It’s the trees and the plants themselves that
interest me, not the mere lifeless jargon of technical
phrases.’</p>

<p>They sat there late into the night, discussing
things musical and West Indian and otherwise,
without any desire to move away or cut
short the conversation; and Dr Whitaker, his
reserve now broken, talked on to them hour
after hour, doing the lion’s share of the conversation,
and delighting them with his transparent
easy talk and open-hearted simplicity. He
was frankly egotistical, of course—all persons of
African blood always are; but his egotism, such as
it was, took the pleasing form of an enthusiasm
about his own pet ideas and pursuits—a love of
music, a love of flowers, a love of his profession,
and a love of Trinidad. To these favourite
notes he recurred fondly again and again, vigorously
defending the violin as an exponent of
human emotion against Edward’s half-insincere
expression of preference for wind instruments;
going into raptures to Nora over the wonderful
beauty of their common home; and describing
to Marian in vivid language the grandeur of
those marvellous tropical forests whose strange
loveliness she had never yet with her own eyes
beheld.</p>

<p>‘Picture to yourself,’ he said, looking out
vaguely beyond the ship on to the star-lit
Atlantic, ‘a great Gothic cathedral or Egyptian
temple—Ely or Karnak, wrought, not in freestone
or marble, but in living trees—with huge
cylindrical columns strengthened below by projecting
buttresses, and supporting overhead, a
hundred feet on high, an unbroken canopy of
interlacing foliage. Dense—so dense that only
an indistinct glimmer of the sky can be seen
here and there through the great canopy, just
as you see Orion’s belt over yonder through the
fringe of clouds upon the gray horizon; and
even the intense tropical sunlight only reaches
the ground at long intervals in little broken
patches of subdued paleness. Then there’s the
solemn silence, weird and gloomy, that produces
in one an almost painful sense of the vast, the
primeval, the mystical, the infinite. Only the
low hum of the insects in the forest shade, the
endless multitudinous whisper of the wind among
the foliage, the faint sound begotten by the
tropical growth itself, breaks the immemorial
stillness in our West Indian woodland. It’s a
world in which man seems to be a noisy intruder,
and where he stands awestruck before
the intense loveliness of nature, in the immediate
presence of her unceasing forces.’</p>

<p>He stopped a moment, not for breath, for it
seemed as if he could pour out language without
an effort, in the profound enthusiasm of youth,
but to take his violin once more tenderly from
its case and hold it out, hesitating, before him.
‘Will you let me play you just one more little
piece?’ he asked apologetically. ‘It’s a piece
of my own, into which I’ve tried to put some
of the feelings about these tropical forests that
I never could possibly express in words. I call
it “Souvenirs des Lianes.” Will you let me
play it to you?—I shan’t be boring you?—Thank
you—thank you.’</p>

<p>He stood up before them in the pale light
of that summer evening, tall and erect, violin
on breast and bow in hand, and began pouring
forth from his responsive instrument a slow
flood of low, plaintive, mysterious music. It was
not difficult to see what had inspired his brain
and hand in that strangely weird and expressive
piece. The profound shade and gloom of
the forest, the great roof of overarching foliage,
the flutter of the endless leaves before the breeze,
the confused murmur of the myriad wings and
voices of the insects, nay, even the very stillness
and silence itself of which he had spoken,
all seemed to breathe forth deeply and solemnly
on his quivering strings. It was a triumph of
art over its own resources. On the organ or
the flute, one would have said beforehand, such
effects as these might indeed be obtained, but
surely never, never on the violin. Yet in Dr
Whitaker’s hand that scraping bow seemed capable
of expressing even what he himself had
called the sense of the vast, the primeval, and
the infinite. They listened all in hushed silence,
and scarcely so much as dared to breathe while
the soft pensive cadences still floated out solemnly
across the calm ocean. And when he had finished,
they sat for a few minutes in perfect silence,
rendering the performer that instinctive homage
of mute applause which is so far more really
eloquent than any mere formal and conventional
expression of thanks ‘for your charming
playing.’</p>

<p>As they sat so, each musing quietly over the
various emotions aroused within them by the
mulatto’s forest echoes, one of the white gentlemen
in the stern, a young English officer on
his way out to join a West Indian regiment,
came up suddenly behind them, clapped his hand
familiarly on Edward’s back, and said in a loud
and cheerful tone: ‘Come along, Hawthorn;
we’ve had enough of this music now—thank
you very much, Dr Thingummy—let’s all go
down to the saloon, I say, and have a game
of nap or a quiet rubber.’</p>

<p>Even Nora felt in her heart as though she
had suddenly been recalled by that untimely
voice from some higher world to this vulgar,
commonplace little planet of ours, the young
officer had broken in so rudely on her silent
reverie. She drew her dainty white lamb’s-wool
wrapper closer around her shoulders with a faint
sigh, slipped her hand gently through Marian’s
arm, and moved away, slowly and thoughtfully,
toward the companion-ladder. As she reached
the doorway, she turned round, as if half ashamed
of her own graciousness, and said in a low
and genuine voice: ‘Thank you, Dr Whitaker—thank
you very much indeed. We’ve so greatly
enjoyed the treat you’ve given us.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">{118}</span></p>

<p>The mulatto bowed and said nothing; but
instead of retiring to the saloon with the others,
he put his violin case quietly under his arm,
and walking alone to the stern of the vessel,
leant upon the gunwale long and mutely, looking
over with all his eyes deep and far into the silent,
heaving, moonlit water. The sound of Nora’s
voice thanking him reverberated long through
all the echoing chambers of his memory.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be a matter of considerable interest if
statistics could be obtained showing the number
of parents who at the present time find themselves
under the necessity of answering that
much-debated question, ‘What shall I do with
my sons?’ The comparatively narrow paths which
lead to fame and prosperity are now so densely
crowded by youths of good breeding and education,
that but few parents are able to decide,
without much anxious consideration, which is the
best one for their sons to start life’s journey upon.
Some parents choose the learned professions;
others select a commercial career; while not a
few decide upon a colonial life for their sons.
The wisdom, or otherwise, of this last decision
we do not here propose to discuss. We accept
the plain fact that many well-bred and carefully
nurtured young men annually leave these shores
as emigrants, bound for the British colonies or
the United States. The object of our remarks
is to present to the fathers of these young emigrants
what the writer—who has seen much,
both of emigrants and emigration, on both sides
of the Atlantic—regards as a piece of sorely
needed advice upon one point of the great
question of emigration, as it affects the sons of
English gentlemen and ‘blue-blooded boys’ in
general.</p>

<p>The average British parent is, as a rule, very
ignorant of everything connected with life and
labour in the colonies. He is perhaps a fairly
successful man of business, or has risen in his
profession; but in attaining this success, he
has probably been so engrossed with his own
occupations, that he has found but little opportunity
of turning his attention to matters concerning
him less closely. It is not indeed to
be expected that any one man should be intimately
acquainted with many different subjects.
In these days of competition, the division of
knowledge is as necessary as the division of
labour; and it is the duty of those who are
practically acquainted with emigration or any
other subject to advise those who are not so
well informed. This is what we now propose
to do. We desire that our remarks upon the
farm-pupil system in the British colonies be
understood to apply equally to the Western
States of America, which, so far as this article
is concerned, are to all intents and purposes
British colonies.</p>

<p>To the youth who has been brought up in a
comfortable English home, under the care of
watchful parents, emigration to any of the
colonies brings a very rude and abrupt change
of life. Thenceforth, parental oversight will be
no longer obtainable, and the young emigrant
will have to seek his own living among strangers
in a strange land, where evil influences
are generally numerous, where the ordinary mode
of life is often very rough, and where no one
need hope for success unless he is willing and
able actually to perform hard manual labour.
Under these circumstances, it naturally appears
desirable to most parents to do all that lies within
their power to obtain for their sons some training
to fit them for their future life. This
desire has called into existence the system under
which many moderately well-to-do young emigrants,
on first leaving England, agree to pay
a premium to some colonist who is already
established on a farm of his own, in order that
they may be taught colonial farming.</p>

<p>The system is not in any way essentially a bad
one; but it is open to great abuses, and in too
many cases leads to fraud. No detailed rules
for the guidance of the parents of young emigrants
in this matter can be laid down. The
necessities vary according to the circumstances
of each particular case. But, in a general way,
it may be stated that, when the parents of a
youth can afford to pay a premium for his
instruction, and have ascertained that the settler
with whom they are placing their son is in a
position faithfully to exercise that amount of
oversight which they desire for him, there cannot
be any very great abuse of the system.
At the same time, it must be admitted that
there is seldom any necessity why a premium
should be paid. If the young emigrant be steady
and of average push and intelligence, there is
certainly little or nothing to prevent him obtaining
all the experience he requires without paying
any premium. Nevertheless, a youth of weak
character, easily led away, and of indolent habits,
may of course be benefited by a certain amount
of care and oversight.</p>

<p>Farming, as practised in the colonies and
in the Western States of America, is of the
most elementary kind. A person of limited
abilities may very easily acquire a knowledge
of all its details. Moreover, in these thinly
peopled countries, labourers are in great demand.
It may be safely asserted that, in those colonies
and in those portions of the west of America
to which emigration is now chiefly directed, any
young man, willing and able to perform ordinary
farm-work, will find little difficulty in obtaining
employment, at least during the summer months,
in spite of the large number of men who are
almost always in want of work in large cities.
A perfect novice may find it necessary to work
for a time for his board and lodging merely;
but after a while, he will probably find himself
in a position to demand at least sufficient wages,
in addition to his board and keep, to maintain
himself respectably. If the young emigrant follows
the course thus suggested, he may not find
his path quite so smooth as that of the young
man who has paid his premium; but he will
have a better chance of obtaining practical
experience of farming. He will live in his
master’s house, board at his table, and be treated
very much as a member of the family—indeed,
the premiumed pupil could hardly be better
off; but he will be compelled to learn in a
way which he who pays a premium can hardly
be, and he will actually be paid for gaining
the experience he requires, instead of paying
for it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">{119}</span></p>

<p>The eagerness on the part of colonial farmers
to obtain farm-pupils is capable of a very simple
explanation. In most cases, these men know
well enough that there is no real need for the
system to be followed; but if they can succeed
in obtaining a pupil, they are hardly to be
blamed for so doing, as it is no slight advantage
to themselves. In the colonies, the harvest
usually is plentiful, while the labourers are few,
and labour, consequently, is expensive. Obviously,
therefore, a pupil who will pay to work
and who will not be constantly wanting to leave,
is a very great boon to any settler. It should
be clearly recognised that, in most cases, if the
pupil works in such a way as he must do if he
is to obtain a useful practical knowledge of his
occupation, his labour alone will amply remunerate
the farmer, even if the latter has to find
both board and lodging. Clearly, therefore, if
a substantial premium be added, the advantage
to the settler is considerable. The pupil-system
often affords a good deal of amusement to keen-sighted
Americans who are in a position to see
its weak points. Not unfrequently the writer
has had said to him on the other side of the
Atlantic: ‘How uncommonly stupid you English
people must be to be willing to pay to work!’
This expression not inaptly sums up the whole
case.</p>

<p>The abuses to which the system is open are
many. In the first place, an exorbitant sum—sometimes
as much as one hundred pounds—is
asked. Considering that the pupil could in
most cases obtain the necessary experience without
paying any premium, and that he actually
remunerates the settler by working for him, we
consider that, under all ordinary circumstances, ten
pounds paid to the settler is ample. In the next
place, an agent of some kind is necessary to mediate
between the parents of a youth and the colonial
settler; and either this agent or the settler, or
both, may be dishonest, and fail to fulfil their
contracts; indeed, the difficulty which a parent
would meet with in attempting to compel
a defaulting settler to carry out his agreement,
is a great incentive to fraud. Only a short time
ago it was reported in the daily papers that
a number of youths who had paid premiums to
an agent in England to be placed with farmers
in California, found, on their arrival there, that
no arrangements whatever had been made for
their reception—in short, that they had been
swindled. Similar cases have been heard of
before. At the same time, we do not wish to
say that there are not honest agencies.</p>

<p>Those who have seen most of the hap-hazard
way in which emigration, not only of the poorer,
but also of the better classes, is carried on from
this country, often express amazement at the
injudicious acts which are constantly being committed
by ill-advised young emigrants and their
blind though well-meaning parents. The needless
paying of premiums by parents who can ill
afford to spare the money is but one of these
indiscretions. Passing over without comment
the practice of shipping ‘ne’er-do-wells’ off to
the colonies in the vain hope that they will do
better there than at home, we cannot help
remarking that numbers of promising young men,
who are utterly unfitted for the life of an
emigrant, are constantly being sent out, and
either they, or the country to which they are
sent, subsequently get blamed for an almost inevitable
failure. Nothing, too, could be more
injudicious than the placing of capital in the
hands of inexperienced young emigrants at the
outset of their career. In a large number of
cases it is wholly lost; indeed, it is a common
saying in America that but few young Englishmen
commence to make headway in their new
home until they have either lost or spent all
they originally brought out with them and have
had to buckle-to in sober earnest. As recommended
in a late number (No. 95) of this <i>Journal</i>,
those who are intended for a colonial career
should go through a course of school-training
especially intended to fit them for it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the exception of her eyes and her teeth, Miss
Wakefield was an ordinary, nay, almost a benevolent,
woman. About sixty years of age, with
a figure perfectly straight and supple, and wearing
her own hair, which was purple black, she might
have passed for forty, save for the innumerable
lines and wrinkles on her face. Her eyes were
full of a furtive evil light, and never failed to
cast a baleful influence over the spectator; her
teeth were large and white, but gapped here
and there in the front like a saw. Mr Slimm
mentally compared her with some choice assortments
of womankind he had encountered in the
mines and kindred places, and they did not suffer
in the comparison.</p>

<p>‘Your business?’ she said coldly.</p>

<p>‘Madam, you will do me the favour to sit
down,’ he replied. ‘What I have to say will
take a considerable time.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ she said, with the same frigid
air; ‘I prefer to stand.’ Some subtle instinct
told her this visit boded no good, and she knew
in dealing with an adversary what an advantage
a standing position gives one.</p>

<p>By way of answer, Mr Slimm continued standing
also.</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he commenced, ‘what I have to say
to you concerns the affairs of the late Mr Morton
of Eastwood. He was an old friend of mine.
Very recently, I heard of his death. I am determined
to have justice done.’</p>

<p>Was it fancy, or did these thin feline lips grow
white? He could have sworn he saw them
quiver. Anyway, fancy or not, if the worst
came to the worst, he had a great card to
play.</p>

<p>Mr Slimm continued: ‘He died, as you are
aware, after a curious illness, and rather suddenly
at the last. If I am correct, there was no
inquest.’</p>

<p>It was not fancy, then! Mr Slimm’s keen
eyes detected a sudden shiver agitate her frame,
and his ear caught a quick painful respiration.
Why did no one think of this? he said to
himself.</p>

<p>‘However, for the present we will pass that
over. Mr Morton was known to have been a
rich man. All he had was left, I understand, to
you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">{120}</span></p>

<p>‘In that, sir, you are perfectly right. Pray,
continue.’</p>

<p>‘Now, at one time, I understand, poor Morton
intended to leave everything to his niece. Was
that so?’</p>

<p>Miss Wakefield inclined her head coldly.</p>

<p>‘And since his death, not the slightest trace
of the bulk of the money has been discovered.
Is that not so?’</p>

<p>Miss Wakefield inclined her head once more.</p>

<p>‘Well, we have now discovered where the
money is.’</p>

<p>‘Discovered where the money is! where <i>my</i>
money is!’ the woman cried with a grating
laugh. ‘And I presume you came to bring it to
me. After all this long while, fancy getting my
own at last!’</p>

<p>‘I suppose you will do something for Mrs
Seaton?’ inquired Slimm.</p>

<p>‘Do something for them—of course I will,’
she laughed hardly. ‘I’ll go and call on them.
I will let them see me ride in my carriage,
while they are begging in the gutter. I will
give them a sixpence when they come to ask
alms at my house.—Oh, tell me, are they starving?—are
they starving, I say?’ she gasped in
her passionate utterance, clutching the American
by the arm. ‘Are they living on charity? Oh,
I hope so—I hope so, for I hate them—hate
them!’ The last words hissed lingeringly and
spitefully through her teeth.</p>

<p>‘Well, not quite,’ Slimm replied cheerfully.
‘It must be consoling to your womanly feelings
to know they are getting on first-rate—in fact,
they are as happy and comfortable as two people
can be.’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry for that,’ she said, with a little
pant between each word. ‘I hoped they were
starving. What right have they to be happy,
when I am so miserable?’</p>

<p>‘Really, madam, it is no pleasure to bring
you news, you take it so uncomfortably,’ Slimm
replied. ‘These histrionics, I know, are intended
merely to disguise your delicate and tender feelings.
Now, we admit this money belongs to
you. What will you stand for the information?
‘Forty thousand pounds is a lot of money.’</p>

<p>‘Not one farthing,’ replied the woman—‘not
one single farthing. The money is mine, and
mine it shall remain.’</p>

<p>‘In that case,’ said Slimm cheerfully, ‘my
mission is at an end.—I wish you a very good-morning.’</p>

<p>‘Stop! Do you mean to say you intend to
hold the secret unless I agree to some terms?’</p>

<p>‘Your powers of penetration do you credit,
madam. That is precisely what I do mean.’</p>

<p>‘And what, pray, is the price placed upon your
secret?’</p>

<p>‘Half!’</p>

<p>‘Half!’ she echoed, with a bitter laugh. ‘You
are joking. Twenty thousand pounds! Oh, you
have made a mistake. You should go to a millionaire,
not come to me.’</p>

<p>‘Do I understand you to decline?’</p>

<p>‘Decline!’ she exclaimed in a fury. ‘Rather
than pay that money to them, I would starve
and rot! Rather than pay that, the money
shall remain in its secret hiding-place till it is
forgotten!—Do you take me for an idiot, a drivelling
old woman with one foot in the grave? No,
no, no! You do not know Selina Wakefield
yet. Twenty thousand pounds. Ah, ah, ah!
The fools, the fools, the miserable fools, to come
and ask me this!’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you will be good enough to name a
sum you consider to be equivalent to the service
rendered,’ said the American, totally unmoved
by this torrent of invective.</p>

<p>‘Now you talk like a man of sense,’ she
replied. ‘You are quite determined, I see, not
to part with your secret until you have a
return. Well, let me see. What do you say to
a thousand pounds, or, to stretch a point, fifteen
hundred?’</p>

<p>‘Appalling generosity!’ replied Slimm, regarding
the ceiling in rapture—‘wasteful extravagance!
I cannot accept it. My principals are
so grasping, you know. Now, as a personal
favour, and to settle this little difficulty, could
not you add, say, another five pounds?’</p>

<p>‘Not another farthing.’</p>

<p>‘Then I am afraid our interview is at an
end,’ he said regretfully.—‘Now, look here. My
friends are in no need of money, and are a long
way from the state you charitably hoped to find
them in. You are getting on in life, and we
can afford to wait. When you are no more—not
to put too fine a point upon it—we shall
lay hands on the treasure, and live happily ever
after—yes, madam.’</p>

<p>‘What do you want me to do?’ she said
sulkily.</p>

<p>‘Let me put it another way. Suppose we
come to an agreement. It is highly probable
that where the money is, a will is concealed.
Now, it is very certain that this will is made in
Mrs Seaton’s favour. If we make an arrangement
to divide the spoil, and that turns out
to be so, what a good thing it will be for you!
On the other hand, if there is no will, you
still have a handsome sum of money, which
without our aid you can never enjoy; and do
not mistake me when I say that aid will never
be accorded without some benefit to the parties
I have the honour to represent.’</p>

<p>‘And suppose I refuse?’</p>

<p>‘So much the worse for you. Then we have
another course open, and one I decidedly advocate.
We will at our own risk recover the
money, trusting to our good fortune to find the
will. If not, we will throw the money in
Chancery, and fight you for it on the ground
of undue influence and fraud.’</p>

<p>‘Fraud, sir! What do you mean?’ exclaimed
the lady, trembling with indignation and hatred.</p>

<p>Mr Slimm approached her more closely, and
looking sternly into her eyes, said: ‘Mark me,
madam!—the Seatons are not unfriended. I am
by no means a poor man myself, and I will not
leave a stone unturned to unravel this mystery.
Do you think I am fool enough to believe that
my old friend hid his money away in this
strange manner unless he had some fear? and
if I mistake not, you are the cause of that fear.
Had he intended his wealth for you, he would
have left it openly. Nothing shall be left undone
to fathom the matter; and if necessary’—here
he lowered his voice to an impressive
whisper—‘the body shall be exhumed. Do you
understand, madam?—exhumed?’</p>

<p>The pallor on the woman’s face deepened to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">{121}</span>
ghastly ashen gray. ‘What would you have me
do?’ she exclaimed faintly.</p>

<p>‘Come to our terms, and all will be well,’
Slimm said, pursuing the advantage he had
gained; ‘otherwise’—here he paused—‘however,
we will say nothing about that. What I propose
is this: that an agreement be drawn up and
entered into upon the terms, that in case no
will is found with the money, the property is
divided; and if a will is found leaving the
property to Mrs Seaton, you take five thousand
pounds. That is my final offer.’</p>

<p>‘I—I consent,’ she faltered humbly, at the
same time longing, in her passionate madness,
to do her antagonist some deadly mischief, as
he stood before her so calmly triumphant.</p>

<p>‘Very good,’ he said quietly—‘very good.
Then I presume our intercourse is at an end.
You will be good enough to be at Mr Carver’s
office in Bedford Row at three o’clock to-morrow
afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘One moment. Are you in the secret?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, I have that felicity. But why?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps now we have come to terms, you may
be good enough to tell me where it is.’</p>

<p>‘Curiosity, thy name is woman,’ said Slimm
sententiously. ‘I am sorry I cannot gratify that
little wish; but as you will doubtless be present
at the opening ceremony, you will not object
to restrain your curiosity for the present—Good-morning.’</p>

<p>Miss Wakefield watched our ambassador’s cab
leave the door, and then threw herself, in the
abandonment of her passion, upon the floor.
In the impotence of her rage and despair,
she lay there, rolling like a mad dog, tearing
at her long nails with the strong uneven teeth.
‘What does he know?’ she hissed. ‘What can
he know? Beaten, beaten at last!’</p>

<p>‘What a woman!’ soliloquised Slimm as he
rolled back Londonwards. ‘I must have a cigar,
to get the flavour out of my mouth.’</p>

<p>When he arrived at Mr Carver’s, he found
Eleanor and her husband awaiting him with
great impatience.</p>

<p>‘What cheer, my comrade?’ Edgar asked with
assumed cheerfulness.</p>

<p>‘Considering the circumstances of the case and
the imminent risk I ran, you might at least have
expressed a desire to weep upon this rugged
bosom,’ Slimm answered reproachfully. ‘I found
the evil, like most evils, not half so bad when
it is properly faced.’</p>

<p>‘And Miss Wakefield?’ asked Mr Carver
anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Gentle as a sucking-dove—only too anxious to
meet our views. In fact, I so far tamed her
that she has made an appointment to come here
to-morrow to settle preliminaries.’</p>

<p>‘But what sort of terms did you come to?’
Eleanor asked.</p>

<p>Slimm briefly related the result of his mission,
and its unexpected and desirable consummation,
to the mutual astonishment of his listeners;
indeed, when he came to review the circumstances
of the case, he was somewhat astonished
at his own success.</p>

<p>‘Wonderful!’ exclaimed Mr Carver, gazing with
intense admiration at his enemy. ‘I could not
have believed it possible for one man single-handed
to have accomplished so much.—My good
friend, do I really understand that in any case
we get half the money; and in one case, all but
five thousand pounds?’</p>

<p>‘Precisely; and you get the agreement drawn
up, and we will get away to Eastwood the day
after to-morrow. I declare I feel as pleased as
a schoolboy who has found the apple at hide-and-seek.
I feel as if I was getting young again.’</p>

<p>‘Then you think it is really settled?’ Edgar
asked, with a sigh of pleasure and relief.</p>

<p>‘Not the slightest doubt of it,’ said the
American promptly. ‘And I think I may be
allowed to observe, that of all the strange things
I ever came across throughout my long and
checkered career, this is about the strangest.’</p>

<p>‘It certainly beats anything I ever remember,’
said Mr Carver with a buoyant air.—‘What do
you say, Bates?’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir,’ Mr Bates admitted, ‘there certainly
are some points about it one does not generally
encounter in the ordinary run of business.’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p>When the poet, in the pursuit of his fancy,
eulogised the stately homes of England, he must
have forgotten or totally ignored a class of
dwelling dearer to my mind than all the marble
halls the taste or vanity of man ever designed.
The Duke of Stilton doubtless prefers his
ancestral home, with its towers and turrets, its
capacious stables—which, by-the-bye, seem the
first consideration in the Brobdingnagian erections
of the hour; he may wander with an air of
pride through the Raphael hall and the Teniers
gallery or the Cuyp drawing-room. For me, he
can have his art treasures, his Carrara marbles,
his priceless Wedgwood, his Dresden. He may
enjoy his drawing-rooms—blue, red, and every
colour in the universe. He may dine in the
bosom of his family on every delicacy a <i>cordon
bleu</i> can devise to tickle the palate and stimulate
the appetite, with its accompaniment of
rose-patterned silver and dainty china. Let him
luxuriate in it all, if he will.</p>

<p>I have in my mind’s eye a house far different
from His Grace’s, but which, nevertheless, if
not rich in costly bric-à-brac, has an appearance
of harmony and refinement refreshing beyond
belief. It is the house, or, if you will, the
villa of Eastwood. Against the main road is a
rugged stone wall, moss-incrusted and lichen-strewn,
and surmounted by dense laurel. Opening
the old-fashioned wooden gate, a broad path
leads to the door, which is some forty yards
away, at the side of the house. It is a low,
gray stone house, clustered with ivy and clematis,
and climbing roses twisting round the long
double row of windows. In front is the lawn,
quite half an acre in extent, and shut off from
a garden by a brick wall, covered with apricot
and nectarine. On the right, leading towards
the house, is a sloping bank, all white and fragrant
in spring with violets; and above this
bank, approached by an ancient horse-block, is
the old-world garden. It is a large garden, with
broad green paths, sheltered by bowers of apple-trees,
and the borders gay with wall-flowers,
mignonette, stocks, pansies, London-pride, Tom-Thumb,
and here and there great bushes of
lavender and old-man. Far down is a walk of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">{122}</span>
filbert trees, where the wily squirrel makes
merry in the harvest-time, and the cherry-trees
all melodious with the song of the blackbird.
There is a balmy smell here of thyme and sage
and endive, and the variety of sweet herbs which
our grandmothers were wont to cull in autumn,
and suspend in muslin bags from the kitchen
rafters.</p>

<p>Opening the heavy hall door with the licensed
freedom of the novelist, we find ourselves in the
hall, whence we reach the drawing-room. Here
we find our friends, awaiting the arrival of Miss
Wakefield. They have been talking and chatting
gaily; but as the time for that lady’s arrival draws
near, conversation becomes flat, and there is an
air of expectation and suppressed excitement
about them, which would at once convince the
observer that something important was on hand.</p>

<p>Mr Carver rose from his seat, and, for about
the fiftieth time, walked to the window and
looked out. It was amusing to note his easy
air and debonair appearance, which was palpably
assumed to impress the spectators with the idea
that he was by no means anxious. The only
member of the party who really could be said
to be at ease was Mr Bates. He wore his best
clothes, and had an air of resigned settled melancholy,
evidently expecting the worst, and prepared
to have his cup of joy—representing in
his case his partnership—dashed from his lips
at the last moment.</p>

<p>Felix was discussing the affair with Edgar in
a low voice, and Eleanor sat white and still,
only showing her impatience ever and anon
by a gentle tap upon the floor with her heel.
Mr Slimm was whistling softly in a low key,
and industriously engaged in whittling a stick
in his hand. Mr Carver returned from his post
of observation and threw himself back in his
chair with an involuntary sigh. Slimm put up
his knife.</p>

<p>‘I vote we begin,’ said Edgar at length.</p>

<p>‘No, no; it would not do—it really would
not do,’ interposed Mr Carver, seeing the company
generally inclined to this view. ‘The lady
whom we await is capable of anything. If we
found a will in her absence, she would not be
above saying we put it there.’</p>

<p>‘Judging from my limited experience of the
lady, I calculate you are about right, sir,’ said
Mr Slimm. ‘No; after so many years’ patience,
it would certainly be unwise to do anything
rash now.’</p>

<p>‘It is the last few moments which seem so
hard,’ Eleanor said. ‘Suppose, after all, we
should find nothing!’</p>

<p>‘For goodness’ sake, don’t think of such a thing!’
Edgar exclaimed. ‘Fancy, after all this bother
and anxiety!’</p>

<p>The party lapsed into silence again, and once
more Mr Carver strolled towards the window.
It is strange, when one is anxiously waiting for
anything, how slowly time goes. Edgar took his
watch out of his pocket every other minute, like
a schoolboy who wears one for the first time.</p>

<p>‘I think I will walk down the road and see
if she is coming,’ Slimm observed. ‘It would
look a little polite, I think.’</p>

<p>Edgar murmured something touching love’s
young dream, and asked the American if the
fascination was so strong.</p>

<p>‘Well, no,’ he replied. ‘I don’t deny she is
fascinating; but it is not the sort of glamour
that generally thrills the young bosom. One
thing we all agree upon, I think, and that is,
that we shall be all extremely pleased to see
the lady.’</p>

<p>‘That is a strange thing in itself,’ Edgar
replied drily. ‘The damsel is evidently coy.
She is at present, doubtless, struggling with her
emotion. I fancy she does not intend to come.’</p>

<p>At this moment there was a sound of wheels,
and a coach pulled up at the gate. After a
moment, a tall black figure was seen approaching
the house. A few seconds later, Miss Wakefield
entered the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INVESTORS_AND_THE_STOCK_EXCHANGE">INVESTORS AND THE STOCK EXCHANGE.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">SECOND ARTICLE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a former article we endeavoured to explain
the <i>modus operandi</i> of Stock Exchange transactions;
and our object now is to make a few
remarks upon the rights and duties of investors
and members of the Stock Exchange respectively.
As formerly explained, when any business is
transacted on the Stock Exchange, the broker
always renders to his client a contract containing
the particulars of the transaction, which is
understood to be carried through in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the Stock
Exchange. These rules have been compiled
with the strictest regard to the rights and
duties of both parties, and are altered from
time to time as circumstances may require.
They are in complete accordance with the law
of the land; and when any question has arisen
in regard to Stock Exchange affairs, the courts
of law have invariably allowed that those rules
have been framed on the most equitable principles.</p>

<p>When a contract has been rendered, broker
and client are equally bound to fulfil their
part of it: the broker, in the case of a purchase,
to deliver to, his client an authentic certificate
of the stock, and in the case of a sale, to pay
for the stock on delivery of a properly executed
transfer; the client to pay the consideration-money,
&amp;c., when the stock is purchased for
him, and to deliver the transfer duly executed,
with the certificate, when the stock is sold.
Many investors, while looking very sharply after
their rights, entirely lose sight of their duties,
and altogether forget that there must be two
parties to every contract. When a man sells
stock, he is entitled to a cheque for the proceeds
the moment he hands the executed transfer
to his broker, and no sooner; and when stock
is purchased, the broker is entitled to receive
the purchase-money when he delivers the transfer
to his client for signature, and no sooner. Many
persons, however, imagine that if they send
their broker a cheque for stock bought a day
or two after the account-day, it will be time
enough, being ignorant of the fact that the
latter is obliged by the rules to pay for the
stock when it is delivered to him, either on
the account-day or any subsequent day. Those
living at a distance from London should therefore
be careful to let the money be in the
hands of their broker on the morning of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">{123}</span>
account-day at the very latest; or if they
object to pay for stock before receiving it, should
instruct a banker in the City to pay for the stock,
or proportionately for any part, on delivery, so
that the broker may not be out of the money.
Of course, brokers are not supposed to have
unlimited balances at their bankers, and it is
frequently a real hardship for them to be
obliged to find the money as best they can.
The Stock Exchange rules admit of no delay
whatever, and must be acted up to by the
members, without any regard to the negligence
or inattention of the investor.</p>

<p>When stock payable to bearer is not delivered
to the buying-broker on the account-day, he
has the power, on the following day, of ordering
it to be purchased, or ‘bought in’ as it is
called, in the market for immediate delivery,
and any loss consequent upon the buying-in must
be paid by the seller. In the case of registered
stocks, however, ten days after the account-day
are allowed for delivery. This is only reasonable,
as a deed of transfer frequently requires
the signature of several sellers, or the seller
may reside at a distance, and thus delay cannot
be avoided. On the expiry of the time named,
the broker can ‘buy in,’ as in the case of stock
to bearer. If the buyer of stock to bearer does
not receive the stock from his broker within
a day or two after the account-day, or registered
stock within about ten days after the account-day,
he has a perfect right to know the reason
of the delay, and failing any proper excuse,
should give instructions to ‘buy in,’ as explained
above.</p>

<p>The Committee of the Stock Exchange have
always done everything in their power to insure
the strict fulfilment of all bargains entered into
by the members; and if any investor feels
aggrieved or thinks he has been unfairly dealt
with, a letter addressed to the Committee will
at once bring the culprit to book. Accounts are
settled fortnightly, about the middle and end
of each month; and every member of the House
prepares, or ought to prepare, a balance-sheet,
showing exactly how he stands on these occasions.
If a member finds that he is unable to meet his
engagements, he should at once notify the fact
to the Committee, when he will instantly be
declared a defaulter. This disagreeable duty is
performed by an official of the Stock Exchange,
who, after three knocks with a hammer, which
resound through the House, intimates that
‘Mr —— begs to inform the House that he is
unable to comply with his bargains.’ If, as
frequently happens, the defaulter has issued
cheques on the account-day which have been
returned by his banker, the formula is: ‘Mr ——
has not complied with his bargains.’ After such
declaration, the defaulting member is precluded
from any further dealings with his fellow-members,
and his affairs are placed in the
hands of the official assignee, who proceeds to
wind up the estate and distribute whatever
dividend it will realise. The sound of the
dreaded ‘hammer’ produces universal stillness and
apprehension, and where a few seconds before
was heard the hum of many voices and the
sound of hurrying feet, now every ear is on
the alert to hear the name of the proscribed
member. As soon as the name is announced,
it is posted up in a conspicuous part of the
House, exposed to the gaze and subject to the
derogatory remarks of the members for the rest
of the day. As may well be imagined, the fact
of having been ‘hammered,’ whatever a man’s
future life may be, casts a dark shadow which
cannot be got rid of; and investors may be
quite certain that the members of the Stock
Exchange will strain every nerve to avoid the
disgrace. The rules of the House are, however,
inexorable, and the fatal hammer must sound
if engagements are not strictly and promptly
met. In no trade, business, or profession does
the punishment follow so quickly upon the
offence, and it would be well if all commercial
and financial default were as promptly declared
to the world.</p>

<p>As will be seen from what we have said, the
rights and duties of investors and members are
clearly defined, and both parties have a right to
expect them to be carried out with punctuality.
Promptitude is praiseworthy under all circumstances,
but on the Stock Exchange it is essential
for the sake both of members and investors. No
slovenliness or easy slipshod habits of doing
business should be permitted on either side;
and investors, while insisting on their rights,
should bear in mind that their contracts with
their brokers ought to be carried out with
exactitude on their part, to enable the latter
to fulfil their duties towards their fellow-members.</p>

<p>One other point we would urge investors to
bear in mind, and that is, that stockbrokers
are not prophets. Many investors, especially
ladies, think the reverse. We have frequently
heard very hard words indeed used towards
brokers who have been unfortunate enough to
advise a purchase which has turned out badly;
but a moment’s thought must demonstrate the
folly of such expressions of feeling. If a broker
knows positively what course the market is to
take in any particular stock, he has only to
buy or sell it to the amount required for producing
the profit he desires. Many investors,
however, when smarting under losses, are apt
to rush to conclusions which reflection proves
to be utterly unjust. It is true that stockbrokers
ought to be better acquainted with stocks and
everything pertaining thereto than the large
majority of investors; but it is absurd to suppose
that their views should never be wrong. Let
investors be satisfied with a reasonable rate of
interest, never buy stock without the advice of
a stockbroker, never buy what they cannot pay
for, or sell what they are not prepared to deliver,
and we are certain there would be fewer sleepless
pillows and more money in the coffers.</p>

<p>Speculation, we fear, is inherent in the human
constitution, and all that we can say on the
subject is not likely to put a stop to it. It is
natural to the human animal to desire to make
money without working for it, and no doubt
such a state of affairs will exist to the end. But
experience teaches. We once heard an old man,
who had been a large speculator in his early
days, say that if he had put his money into
consols when he first began to save, and continued
doing so, instead of running after high
rates of interest, he would have been a very
much richer man in his old age. In the furious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">{124}</span>
race for riches, we feel certain that the steady
investor has the best of it; and the man who
is not even able to do more than make both
ends meet is infinitely happier than he who
spends restless days and sleepless nights in
the pursuit of that sudden wealth, which he, in
all probability, goes down to his grave without
acquiring.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LADY_GODIVA">THE ‘LADY GODIVA.’</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happened that one summer, a few years ago,
I found myself travelling up the Barwon River,
just where it commences to form the boundary
between Queensland and New South Wales. The
weather was terribly hot, and feed for horses
scarce, so that I was only too glad to accept the
invitation of a hospitable settler, an old acquaintance
in digging days gone by, to stay and ‘spell’
for a week or two, whilst my horses put on
a little condition in his well-grassed paddocks.
The country round about at that time, even
on the river frontages, was very sparsely settled,
and comparatively young people could remember
when the blacks were ‘bad.’ Dingoes, kangaroos,
wild-cattle, and ‘brombees’ or wild-horses,
roamed the great scrubs in thousands; and with
respect to broken-in and branded individuals of
the two latter species, the laws of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>
seemed to be very lightly regarded amongst the
pioneers of the border; and for a settler to put
in an appearance at his neighbour’s killing-yard
whilst the operation of converting bullock into
beef was going on, was deemed the very height
of bad manners, inexcusable, indeed, unless perhaps
in the newest of new-chums, at least till
the hide was off and the brand cut out.</p>

<p>My friend had only recently taken up ground
on the river; but his next and nearest neighbour,
old Tom Dwyer, who resided about five-and-twenty
miles away, was a settler of many years’
standing; and it was from him that, towards the
end of my stay with the Brays, came an invitation
to the wedding festivities of his only
daughter, who was to be married to a young
cousin, also a Dwyer, who followed the occupation
of a drover.</p>

<p>As Bray and myself rode along in the cool
of the early morning—the womenkind and
children having set out by moonlight the night
before in a spring-cart—he gave me a slight
sketch of the people whose hearty invitation we
were accepting.</p>

<p>‘A rum lot,’ said my old friend—a fine specimen
of the bushman-digger type of Australian-born
colonist, hardy, brave, and intelligent, who
had, after many years of a roving, eventful life,
at last settled down to make himself a home
in the wilderness—‘a rum lot, these Dwyers. Not
bad neighbours by no means, at least not to me.
I speak as I find; but people do say that they
come it rather too strong sometimes with the
squatters’ stock, and that young Jim—him as
is goin’ to get switched—and old Tom his uncle
do work the oracle atween ’em. I mind, not
so long ago, young Jim he starts up north somewhere
with about a score head o’ milkers and
their calves; and when he comes back again in
about six months, he fetched along with him
over three hundred head o’ cattle! “Increase,”
he called ’em—ha, ha! A very smart lad is Jim
Dwyer; but the squatters are getting carefuller
now; and I’m afraid, if he don’t mind, that
he’ll find himself in the logs some o’ these fine
days. He’s got a nice bit o’ a place over the
river, on the New South Wales side, has Jim,
just in front o’ Fort Dwyer, as they call the old
man’s camp. You could a’most chuck a stone
from one house to the other.’</p>

<p>So conversing, after about three hours’ steady-riding
through open box forest country, flat and
monotonous, we arrived at ‘Fort Dwyer’—or
Dee-wyer, as invariably pronounced thereabouts—a
long, low building, constructed of huge, roughly
squared logs of nearly fireproof red coolabah, or
swamp-gum, and situated right on the verge of
the steep clay bank, twenty feet below which
glided sullenly along the sluggish Barwon, then
nearly half a ‘banker.’</p>

<p>A hearty welcome greeted us; and the inevitable
‘square-face’ of spirits was at once produced,
to which my companion did justice whilst pledging
the health of the company with a brief,
‘Well, here’s luck, lads!’ For my own part,
not daring to tackle the half-pannikinful of fiery
Mackay rum so pressingly offered, with the assurance
that it was ‘the finest thing out after a
warm ride,’ I paid my respects to an immense
cask of honey-beer which stood under a canopy
of green boughs, thus running some risk of losing
caste as a bushman by appropriating ‘the women’s
swankey,’ as old Dwyer contemptuously termed
it, whilst insisting on ‘tempering’ my drink with
‘just the least taste in life, sir,’ of Port Mackay,
of about 45 o. p. strength.</p>

<p>There must have been fully one hundred people
assembled; and the open space just in front of
the house was crowded with buggies, spring-carts,
wagonettes, and even drays; but the great
centre of attraction was the stockyard, where
Jim Dwyer was breaking-in to the side-saddle
a mare, bought in one of his recent trips ‘up
north,’ and intended as a present for his bride,
of whom I caught a glimpse as she sat on an
empty kerosene tin, with her sleeves rolled up,
busily engaged in plucking poultry; a fair type
of the bush-maiden, tall and slender, with good,
though sharply cut features, deeply browned by
the sun, laughing dark eyes, perfect teeth—a
rare gift amongst young Australians—and as
much at home—so old Bray assured me—on horseback
cutting out ‘scrubbers’ or ‘brombees,’ as
was her husband-elect himself.</p>

<p>The rails of the great stockyard were crowded
with tall, cabbage-tree-hatted, booted and spurred
‘Cornstalks’ and ‘Banana-men’ (natives of New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">{125}</span>
South Wales and Queensland respectively); and
loud were their cries of admiration, as young
Dwyer, on the beautiful and, to my eyes, nearly
thoroughbred black mare, cantered round and
round, whilst flourishing an old riding-skirt about
her flanks.</p>

<p>‘She’ll do, Jim—quiet as a sheep’—‘My word!
she’ll carry Annie flying’—‘What did yer give
for her, Jim?’—‘A reg’lar star, an’ no mistake!’
greeted the young man, as, lightly jumping off,
he unbuckled the girths and put the saddle on
the slip-rails.</p>

<p>Jim Dwyer differed little from the ordinary
style of young bush ‘native’—tall, thin, brown,
quick-eyed, narrow in the flanks; but with good
breadth of chest, and feet which, from their
size and shape, might have satisfied even that
captious critic the Lady Hester Stanhope,
under whose instep ‘a kitten could walk,’ that
the Australians of a future nation would not be
as the British, ‘a flat-soled generation, of whom
no great or noble achievement could ever be
expected.’</p>

<p>I fancied that, as the young fellow came forward
to shake hands with Bray, he looked uneasily
and rather suspiciously at me out of the corner
of one of his black eyes. My companion evidently
observed it also, for he said laughingly:
‘What’s the matter, Jim? Only a friend of
mine. Is the mare “on the cross?” And did
you think he was a “trap?”’</p>

<p>‘None o’ your business, Jack Bray,’ was the
surly reply. ‘“Cross” or “square,” she’s mine
till some one comes along who can show a
better right to her, an’ that won’t happen in a
hurry.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well,’ replied Bray, ‘you needn’t get
crusty so confounded quick. But she’s a pretty
thing, sure enough. Let’s go and have a look
at her.’</p>

<p>Everybody now crowded round the mare, praising
and admiring her. ‘Two year old, just,’ exclaimed
one, looking in her mouth.—‘Rising
three, I say,’ replied another.—‘And a cleanskin,
and unbranded!’ ejaculated Bray, at the
same time passing his hand along the mare’s
wither.</p>

<p>‘That’s a disease can soon be cured,’ said
Dwyer with a laugh. ‘I’m agoin’ to clap the
J. D. on her now.—Shove her in the botte, boys,
while I go an’ fetch the irons up.’</p>

<p>‘That mare’s a thoroughbred, and a race-mare
to boot, and she’s “on the cross” right enough,’
whispered Bray, as we walked back towards the
house. ‘She’s been shook; and though she
ain’t fire-branded, there’s a half-sovereign let in
under the skin just below the wither; I felt it
quite plain; and I wouldn’t wonder but there’s
a lot more private marks on her as we can’t
see.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think, then,’ I asked, ‘that young
Dwyer stole her?’</p>

<p>‘Likely enough, likely enough,’ was the reply.
‘But if he did, strikes me as we’ll hear more
about the matter yet.’</p>

<p>Just at this moment, shouts of, ‘Here’s the
parson!’—‘Here’s old Ben!’ drew our attention
to a horseman who was coming along the narrow
track at a slow canter.</p>

<p>A well-known character throughout the whole
of that immense district was the Rev. Benjamin
Back, ‘bush missionary;’ and not less well known
was his old bald-faced horse Jerry. The pair bore
a grotesque resemblance to each other, both being
long and ungainly, both thin and gray, both always
ready to eat and drink, and yet always looking
desolate and forlorn. As the Rev. Ben disengaged
his long legs from the stirrups, the irrepressible
old Dwyer appeared with the greeting-cup—a
tin pint-pot half full of rum—which swallowing
with scarcely a wink, to the great admiration
of the lookers-on, the parson, commending Jerry
to the care of his host, stalked inside, and was
soon busy at the long table, working away at a
couple of roast-ducks, a ham, and other trifles,
washed down with copious draughts of hot tea,
simply remarking to ‘Annie,’ that she ‘had better
make haste and clean herself, so that he could put
her and Jim through, as he had to go on to Bullarora
that evening to bury a child for the
Lacies.’</p>

<p>Having at length finished his repast, all hands
crowded into the long room, where before ‘old
Ben’ stood bride and bridegroom, the former
neatly dressed in dark merino—her own especial
choice, as I was told, in preference to anything
gayer—with here and there a bright-coloured
ribbon, whilst in her luxuriant black hair and
in the breast of her dress were bunches of freshly
plucked orange blossoms, that many a belle of
proud Mayfair might have envied. The bridegroom
in spotless white shirt, with handkerchief
of crimson silk, confined loosely around his neck
by a massive gold ring, riding-trousers of Bedford
cord, kept up by a broad belt, worked in wools
of many colours by his bride, and shining top-boots
and spurs, looked the very beau-idéal of
a dashing stockman, as he bore himself elate and
proudly, without a trace of that bucolic sheepishness
so often witnessed in the principal party to
similar contracts.</p>

<p>The old parson, with the perspiration induced
by recent gastronomic efforts rolling in beads off
his bald head, and dropping from the tip of
his nose on to the church-service in his hand,
had taken off his long coat of threadbare rusty
black, and stood confessed in shirt of hue almost
akin to that of the long leggings that reached
above his knees. It was meltingly hot; and the
thermometer—had there been such an article—would
have registered one hundred and ten or
one hundred and fifteen degrees in the shade at
the least. But it was all over at last. Solemnly
‘old Ben’ had kissed the darkly flushing bride,
and told her to be a good girl to Jim—solemnly
the old man had disposed of another ‘parting
cup;’ and then, whilst the womenkind filled
his saddle-bags with cake, chicken, and ham,
together with the generous half of a ‘square-face’—or
large square-sided bottle—containing
his favourite summer beverage, old Dwyer,
emerging from one of the inner rooms, produced
a piece of well-worn bluish-tinted paper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">{126}</span>
known and appreciated in those regions as
a ‘bluey,’ at sight of which the parson’s eye
glistened, for seldom was it that he had the
fortune to come across such a liberal douceur as
a five-pound note; but as old Dwyer said: ‘We
don’t often have a job like this one for you
Ben, old man. We’re pretty well in just now,
an’ I mean you shall remember it. An’ look
here; Jerry’s getting pretty poor now, an’ I know
myself he’s no chicken; so you’d best leave
him on the grass with us for the rest o’ his days,
an’ I’ll give you as game a bit o’ horse-flesh as
ever stepped; quiet, too, an’ a good pacer. See!
the boys is a-saddlin’ him up now.’</p>

<p>The old preacher’s life was hard, for the most
part barren, and little moistened by kind offers
like the present; and his grim and wrinkled face
puckered up and worked curiously as he gratefully
accepted the gift for Jerry’s sake, his constant
companion through twelve long years of
travel incessant through the wildest parts of
Queensland; and with a parting injunction to
‘the boys’ to look after the old horse, he,
mounting his new steed, started off on his thirty-mile
ride to bury Lacy’s little child.</p>

<p>The long tables, at which all hands had intermittently
appeased their hunger throughout the
day, on fowls, geese, turkeys, sucking-pig, fish,
&amp;c., were now cleared and removed; a couple
of concertinas struck up, and fifteen or twenty
couples were soon dancing with might and main
on the pine-boarded floor. Old men and young,
old women and maidens, boys and girls, all went
at it with a will, whirling, stamping, changing
and ‘chaining’ till the substantial old house
shook again, and fears were audibly expressed
that the whole building would topple over into
the river.</p>

<p>‘Not to-night, of all nights in the year,’ said
old Dwyer; ‘although I do believe I’ll have
to shift afore long. Ye’ll hardly think it—would
ye?—that when I first put up the old shanty, it
stood four chain, good, away from the bank;
it was, though, all that; an’ many a sneaking,
greasy black-fellow I’ve seen go slap into the
water with a rifle bullet through his ugly carcass
out of that back-winder, though it is plumb
a’most with the river now.’</p>

<p>So, louder and louder screamed the concertinas,
faster and faster whirled the panting couples, till
nearly midnight, when ‘supper’ was announced
by the sound of a great bullock bell, and out
into the calm night-air trooped the crowd. The
tables this time had been set out on the sward
in front of the house, just without the long
dark line of forest which bordered the river,
through the tops of whose giant ‘belars’ the
full moon shone down on the merry feasters
with a subdued glory; whilst, in a quiet
pause, you could hear the rush of the strong
Barwon current, broken, every now and again,
by a deep-sounding ‘plop,’ as some fragment of
the ever-receding clayey bank would fall into
the water. Four or five native bears, disturbed
by the noise, crawled out on the limbs of a
great coolabar, and with unwinking, beady-black
eyes, gazed on the scene below, expressing their
astonishment every now and again in hoarse
mutterings, now low and almost inarticulate,
then ‘thrum, thrumming’ through the bush till
it rang again. From a neighbouring swamp came
the shrill scream of the curlew; whilst far away
in the low ranges of Cooyella, could be heard
the dismal howl of a solitary dingo coo-ee-ing
to his mates.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the guests taken their seats and
commenced, amidst jokes and laughter, to attack
a fresh and substantial meal, when a furious
barking, from a pack of about fifty dogs,
announced the advent of strangers; and in a
minute more, three horsemen, in the uniform
of the Queensland mounted police, rode up to
the tables. One, a sergeant apparently, dismounted,
and with his bridle over his arm,
strode forward, commanding every one to keep
their seats; for several at first sight of the ‘traps’
had risen, and apparently thought of quietly
slipping away. This order, however, enforced
as it was by the production of a revolver, together
with an evident intention of using it
on any absconder, brought them to their seats
again.</p>

<p>‘What’s all this about?’ exclaimed old Dwyer.
‘We’re all honest people here, mister, so you can
put up your pistol. Tell us civilly what it is
you’re wantin’, an’ we’ll try an’ help you; but
don’t come it too rough. You ought to be ’shamed
o’ yourself. Don’t ye see the faymales?’</p>

<p>‘Can’t help the females,’ retorted the sergeant
sharply. ‘I haven’t ridden four hundred miles to
play polite to a lot of women. I want a man
named James Dwyer; and by the description,
yonder’s the man himself’—pointing at the same
time across the table to where sat the newly-made
husband, who had been one of the first to make
a move at sight of the police.</p>

<p>‘What’s the charge, sargent?’ asked old Dwyer
coolly.</p>

<p>‘Horse-stealing,’ was the reply; ‘and here’s
the warrant, signed by the magistrate in Tambo,
for his apprehension.’</p>

<p>I was sitting quite close to the object of these
inquiries, and at this moment I heard young Mrs
Dwyer, whilst leaning across towards her husband,
whisper something about ‘the river’ and ‘New
South Wales;’ and in another moment, head over
heels down the steep bank rolled the recently
created benedict, into the curious and cool nuptial
couch of swiftly flowing, reddish water, which he
breasted with ease, making nearly a straight line
for the other bank, distant perhaps a couple of
hundred yards.</p>

<p>The troopers, drawing their revolvers, dismounted,
and running forward, were about to
follow the example set by their superior, who
was taking steady aim at the swimmer, perfectly
discernible in the clear moonlight, when suddenly
half-a-dozen pair of soft but muscular arms
encircled the three representatives of law and
order, as the women, screaming like a lot of
curlews after a thunderstorm, clasped them in a
tight embrace.</p>

<p>Young Mrs Dwyer herself tackled the sergeant,
crying: ‘What! would you shoot a man just for
a bit of horse-sweating! Leave him go, can’t you.
He’s over the border now in New South Wales,
mare and all; and you can’t touch him, even if
you was there.’</p>

<p>Just then a yell of triumph from the scrub on
the other shore seemed to vouch for the fact, and
was answered by a dozen sympathetic whoops and
shouts from the afore-mentioned ‘Cornstalks’ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">{127}</span>
‘Banana-men,’ who crowded along our side of the
river.</p>

<p>The sergeant struggled to free himself; and his
fair antagonist unwound her arms, saying: ‘Come
now, sargent, sit down peaceably and eat your
supper, can’t you! What’s the good of making
such a bother over an old scrubber of a mare!’</p>

<p>‘An old scrubber of a mare!’ repeated the
sergeant aghast ‘D’ye think we’d ride this
far over a scrubber of a mare? Why, it’s the
Lady Godiva he took; old Stanford’s race-mare,
worth five hundred guineas, if she’s worth
a penny. Bother me! if he didn’t take her clean
out of the stable in Tambo, settling-night, after
she’d won the big money! But there, you all
know as much about it as I can tell you, that’s
plain to be seen, for I never mentioned a mare;
it was your own self, I do believe; and I’ll have
him, if I have to follow him to Melbourne.—Just
got married, has he? Well, I can’t help
that; he shouldn’t go stealing race-mares.—Well,
perhaps you didn’t know <i>all</i> about it,’ went on
the sergeant, in reply to the asseverations of the
Dwyer family as regarded their knowledge of
the way the young man had become possessed
of the mare. ‘But,’ shaking his head sententiously,
‘I’m much mistaken if most of this
crowd hadn’t a pretty good idea that there was
something cross about her. However,’ he concluded
philosophically, ‘it’s no use crying over
spilt milk. I’ll have to ride over to G——
at daylight—that’s another forty miles—and get
an extradition warrant out for him. He might
just as well have come quietly at first, for we’re
bound to have the two of them some time or
other.’</p>

<p>It was now nearly daylight; and our party set
out on their return home, leaving the troopers
comfortably seated at the supper, or rather by
this time, breakfast table; while just below the
house, in a bend of the river, we could see, as
we passed along, a group of men busily engaged
in swimming a mob of horses—amongst which
was doubtless the Lady Godiva herself—over to
the New South Wales shore, where, on the bank,
plainly to be discerned in the early dawn, stood
the tall form of her lawless owner.</p>

<p>‘How do you think it will all end?’ I asked
Bray.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ was the reply, ‘they’ll square it, most
likely. I know something of that Stanford;
he’s a bookmaker; and if he gets back the mare
and a cheque for fifty or a hundred pounds, to
cover expenses, he’ll not trouble much after
Jim.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. But the police?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘Easier squared than Stanford,’ answered Bray
dogmatically.</p>

<p>That this ‘squaring’ process was successfully
put in force seemed tolerably certain; for very
shortly afterwards I read that at the autumn
meeting of the N. Q. J. C., the Lady Godiva
had carried off the lion’s share of the money;
and I also had the pleasure of meeting Mr and
Mrs Dwyer in one of Cobb &amp; Co.’s coaches, bound
for the nearest railway terminus, about three
hundred miles distant, thence to spend a month
or so in Sydney; Jim, as his wife informed me,
having done uncommonly well out of a mob of
cattle and horses which he had been travelling
for sale through the colonies; so had determined
to treat himself and the ‘missis,’ for the first
time in their lives, to a look at the ‘big smoke.’</p>

<p>‘That was a great shine at our wedding, wasn’t
it?’ she asked, as the coachman gathered up the
reins preparatory to a fresh start. ‘But’—and
here she tapped her husband on the head with
her parasol—‘I look out now that he don’t go
sticking-up to any more Lady Godivas.’</p>

<p>‘That’s so,’ laughed Jim. ‘I find, that I
have my hands pretty full with the one I
collared the night you were there. I doubt sometimes
I’d done better to have stuck to the other
one; and as for temp’—— Here Jim’s head
disappeared suddenly into the interior of the
coach; crack went the long whip; the horses
plunged, reared, and went through the usual
performance of attempting to tie themselves up
into overhand knots, then darted off at top-speed
on their sixteen-mile stage, soon disappearing in
a cloud of dust along the ‘cleared line.’</p>

<h3>ARTILLERY EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> trials lately carried on at the Bill of Portland,
supplement (says the <i>Times</i>) those of Inchkeith
in certain respects. At Inchkeith it was
sought to obtain a just idea of the effect of
machine-gun and shrapnel fire on the detachment
serving a gun mounted <i>en barbette</i> in an
emplacement of tolerably recent design. Dummies
were placed round the gun in exposed
positions, and Her Majesty’s ship <i>Sultan</i>, under
very favourable conditions of sea and weather,
carried out some careful practice at various
ranges. The results, accurately recorded, furnish
data calculated to serve as a correction to mere
conjecture. At Portland, the objects sought to
be attained were two. The merits of the Moncrieff
or ‘disappearing’ principle of mounting
guns for coast-defence have been much discussed,
and great advantages have been claimed for it
with every show of reason; but no opportunity
had ever been given to the system to practically
demonstrate its defensive value. It was, therefore,
sufficiently desirable that a practical experiment
should be arranged in which ‘service-conditions’
should be observed as far as possible,
so that there might be a something definite to
set against prejudice either in favour of or
against the system. It was proposed, at the
same time, to seek to obtain data as to the
accuracy of howitzer-fire from a floating platform....
To sum up the case with judicial
fairness, the Portland experiments fully bear
out all that the champions of the disappearing
system have asserted; while its opponents—if
there are any such—must perforce admit that
at least nothing whatever is proved against it.
More than this, however, appears to be indicated
by these trials. There seems to be every reason
to believe that all direct fire, whether of heavy
or machine guns, against a disappearing gun
when down, is thrown away; that in the short
time during which this gun need be visible, it
will require a very smart gun-captain on board
ship merely to lay on it; that the more the
smoke obscures it, the better, provided a position-finder
is used; and finally, that to engage two
or three dispersed disappearing guns would be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">{128}</span>
heart-breaking task for a ship. Probably the best
chance of disabling guns mounted on this system
is snap-shooting from the six-pounder quick-firing
gun, which can be bandied almost as readily
as a rifle. But, on the one hand, it does not
necessarily follow that a hit from the six-pounder
would have any effect on the disappearing gun;
and, on the other hand, the latter would be able
to get through a good deal of shooting before
the six-pounder was able to come into effective
action. Again, the six-pounder on board ship
would presumably be met by the six-pounder
on shore, which would shoot rather more accurately;
while, even as opposed to these wonderfully
handy little weapons, the disappearing
system must stand superior to all others. In
a turret or a cupola, more than half the length
of the modern long guns must be always exposed
to fire. All considerations, therefore, seem to
point to the disappearing system as the most
scientific method ever devised for protecting
shore-guns, and the advantages to be obtained
being so great, it becomes worth while to use
every possible effort to bring the disappearing
gun to practical perfection. The main difficulty
is to render the larger guns independently
automatic, and at present no gun larger than
the eight-inch—the gun exhibited in the Inventions
Exhibition—has been thus mounted in
England.</p>


<h3>SEA-GOING FISHING LIFEBOAT VESSELS.</h3>

<p>Mr F. Johnson, the honorary managing secretary
of the National Refuge Harbours Society,
17 Parliament Street, London, has made it the
one aim of his life to devise such means as will
conduce to diminish the large total of lives annually
reported as having been lost at sea. He
is now interesting himself in bringing to a practical
application an invention of Mr John White,
of Cowes, described as a Sea-going Fishing Lifeboat
vessel, a model of which is now on public
view at 72 New Bond Street, London. Broad
in the beam, she has a large air-chamber divided
into two compartments at the bow; another—of
a smaller size—at the stern; and one running
along on either side. Thus, however much sea
she may ‘ship,’ with these air-chambers in use,
it is not possible for her to sink. Except for
the roofs of the fore and aft air-chambers, the
vessel has no deck, an arrangement which of
course gives her considerable buoyancy. The
roofs of the side air-chambers are curved off,
so that any water which might wash over one
bulwark would pass across the vessel and wash
out over the other. As a matter of fact, however,
it is confidently believed that, even in a high
sea, the vessel will be too buoyant to ship
much water. It has naturally occurred to the
inventor that in fine weather the fore air-chamber
might be utilised as a cabin; he has therefore
arranged that it may be unsealed and access
obtained to it by means of a hatchway. It
will be fitted up with cooking apparatus and
beds, the latter articles also filling the rôle of
life-buoys.</p>

<p>Those who interest themselves in this invention
propose that vessels of the kind shall be
launched around our coasts, equipped with fishing-gear,
and manned with smacksmen, so that they
may be ‘self-supporting;’ while their primary
object will be to afford succour during stormy
weather to any craft in distress. Thus, it is
felt that the Fishing Lifeboat vessels might
ride in the different fishing fleets, the smacks
of which, being frequently far away from any
harbour of refuge, are often disabled or utterly
wrecked during a storm. Then, too, the vessels
might fish in the neighbourhood of dangerous
reefs and shoals, where their presence would be
especially valuable. We believe that two or
three years ago a fishing-smack was constructed
very much on the lines indicated, and that, after
effecting some rescues in the neighbourhood of
the Goodwin Sands, she herself was wrecked,
owing to her having been improperly laden with
stone. Mr White has agreed to build Sea-going
Fishing Lifeboat vessels of forty tons—a
size which is considered most suitable—at a cost
each of five hundred pounds. It is felt that a
fair start might be made with twenty vessels,
to be placed at different points around our coasts.
Thus ten thousand pounds is required; and a
public fund has been opened, and part of the
money already subscribed. Those who desire to
contribute should communicate with Mr Johnson,
all cheques being crossed National Provincial
Bank.</p>


<h3>SOME FACTS ABOUT MONTE CARLO.</h3>

<p>The Report, says a contemporary, of the International
Committee in Nice upon the disgraceful
gambling hell of Monte Carlo, which has just
been issued, is to be made the ground of a collective
diplomatic action against the protector
of that institution, Prince Charles III. of Monaco.
This important pamphlet gives a documentary
catalogue of all the suicides which have taken
place in Monte Carlo from 1877 to 1885. The
total number of persons who have destroyed
themselves in consequence of their losses at his
Princely Highness’s gambling-tables is eighteen
hundred and twenty—that is to say, there have
been nearly as many suicides as the Prince has
subjects. The catalogue is very complete, giving
the name, the home, the age, and the date of
death of each suicide, and a collection of the
letters in which the wretched victims have commented
upon their self-destruction. Nearly all
of them curse the hour in which their eyes first
set sight upon Monte Carlo. It is agreeable to
learn from the table of nationality that the
English and Americans have supplied the smallest
number of victims. A tenth of the number are
Germans and Austrians; but the largest contingent
by far has been provided by France, Italy,
and Russia. The appalling census was instituted
by the Italian Consul-general in Nice, who found
ready support from patriotic citizens of other
lands. The callous brutality of the Monaco
‘government,’ if so honourable a name may be
given to this organised gambling Company, is
shown in the treatment of the suicides after their
death. Scarcely one of them, except where
friends have appeared in time to claim the body,
has received a decent burial. After the poor
wretch has lost all that he had, his corpse has
been hurriedly hidden in the poor quarter of the
burial-ground without funeral rites or mourners.</p>
